# Overview
Combining traditional and non-traditional data to make predictions about diabetes

Traditional indicators of diabetes include family history, usage of alcohol and cigarettes, and body mass index (BMI). This dataset, from Kaggle, includes features such as mental health, education, and income. This dataset was used to create two algorithms - one that predicts whether the user currently has diabetes and another that gives the user the odds they develop diabetes. 

I choose diabetes as the focus of this project because I have some general idea of the trends I should expect. My goal with chosing this unique dataset is to reconfigure my algorithms' architectures to create the best prediction models. The overall algorithms generate either a binary (yes or no) response or a finite discrete (0-100) response. The algorithms are in the branches, which each have their own READMEs that will explain each algorithm and the process of how I created the final algorithm. This includes my fine tuning of hyperparameters process and general data analytics.
