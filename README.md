# Overview
Combining traditional and non-traditional data to make predictions about diabetes

Traditional indicators of diabetes include family history, usage of alcohol and cigarettes, and body mass index (BMI). This dataset, from Kaggle, includes features such as mental health, education, and income. This dataset was used to create two algorithms - one that predicts whether the user currently has diabetes and another that gives the user the odds they develop diabetes.
